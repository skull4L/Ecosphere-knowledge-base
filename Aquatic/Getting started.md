Creating an ecosphere is a relatively simple process, all you really require is a [[Aquatic/Containers|suitable conainer|]] and a [[Water bodies|water body.|]]

# Plants
[[Aquatic/Plants/Plants|Plants|]] can be found in most water body, but can alternatively be bought instead, I tend to usually do this as it allows me to use plants that I know work well. However, most native plants will thrive in an ecosphere.

# Animals
[[Aquatic/Animals/Animals|Animals|]] can be found as simply as scooping [[Sediment|sediment|]] from the bottom of whatever water body you choose to use, for more information on collection techniques please see [[Sourcing organisms|sourcing organisms.]]
