Welcome to the ecosphere knowledge base!
This project is aimed at documenting everything I know about ecospheres through my own experiments, research and knowledge of others. I hope you find this place useful!

If you are interested in contributing to this or just have an interest in ecospheres in general, [join our official discord server!](https://discord.gg/VUkMhjbcDV)
